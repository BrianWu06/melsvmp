data(riesby)

riesby_vmp <- mels_vmp(y = "hamd", 
                       beta_formula = ~ week + endog + endweek, 
                       alpha_formula = ~ endog, 
                       tau_formula = ~ week + endog, 
                       id = "id",
                       data = riesby)
summary(riesby_vmp)
```

```{r}
# riesby_vmp_boot <- bootstrap_mels_vmp(riesby_vmp, B = 1000, cores = 10)
riesby_vmp_boot <- bootstrap_mels_vmp(riesby_vmp, B = 1000, parallel = FALSE)
summary(riesby_vmp_boot)
